Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

<!--
context-mode routing rules below were installed from the context-mode MCP plugin
(mksglu/context-mode, npm context-mode@1.0.162) and registered via ./.mcp.json.
They apply ONLY when the context-mode MCP server is active, which loads at SESSION
START -- they are inert until the next web session. Routing here is by CONVENTION:
the MCP server is registered, but context-mode's enforcement/session hooks are NOT
installed, so curl/WebFetch are not hard-blocked and the Memory/Session-Continuity
lookups stay empty until those hooks are added.
-->

# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

context-mode MCP tools available. Rules protect context window from flooding. One unrouted command dumps 56 KB into context.

## Think in Code — MANDATORY

Analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform data: **write code** via `ctx_execute(language, code)`, `console.log()` only the answer. Do NOT read raw data into context. PROGRAM the analysis, not COMPUTE it. Pure JavaScript — Node.js built-ins only (`fs`, `path`, `child_process`). `try/catch`, handle `null`/`undefined`. One script replaces ten tool calls.

## BLOCKED — do NOT attempt

### curl / wget — BLOCKED
Intercepted and replaced with error. Do NOT retry.
Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` or `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")`

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED
`fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, `http.request(` — intercepted. Do NOT retry.
Use: `ctx_execute(language, code)` — only stdout enters context

### WebFetch — BLOCKED
Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)`

## REDIRECTED — use sandbox

### Bash (>20 lines output)
Bash ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`.
Otherwise: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` or `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")`

### Read (for analysis)
Reading to **Edit** → Read correct. Reading to **analyze/explore/summarize** → `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)`.

### Grep — may flood context
Use `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` in sandbox.

## Tool selection

0. **MEMORY**: `ctx_search(sort: "timeline")` — after resume, check prior context before asking user.
1. **GATHER**: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — runs all commands, auto-indexes, returns search. ONE call replaces 30+. Each command: `{label: "header", command: "..."}`.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — all questions as array, ONE call (default relevance mode).
3. **PROCESSING**: `ctx_execute(language, code)` | `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — sandbox, only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` — raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `ctx_index(content, source)` — store in FTS5 for later search.

## Parallel I/O batches

For multi-URL fetches or multi-API calls, **always** include `concurrency: N` (1-8):

- `ctx_batch_execute(commands: [3+ network commands], concurrency: 5)` — gh, curl, dig, docker inspect, multi-region cloud queries
- `ctx_fetch_and_index(requests: [{url, source}, ...], concurrency: 5)` — multi-URL batch fetch

**Use concurrency 4-8** for I/O-bound work (network calls, API queries). **Keep concurrency 1** for CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or commands sharing state (ports, lock files, same-repo writes).

GitHub API rate-limit: cap at 4 for `gh` calls.

## Subagent routing

Routing block auto-injected into subagent prompts. Bash-type subagents upgraded to general-purpose. No manual instruction needed.

## Output

Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Return: file path + 1-line description.
Descriptive source labels for `ctx_search(source: "label")`.

## Session Continuity

Skills, roles, and decisions persist for the entire session. Do not abandon them as the conversation grows.

## Memory

Session history is persistent and searchable. On resume, search BEFORE asking the user:

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| What were we working on? | `ctx_search(queries: ["summary"], source: "compaction", sort: "timeline")` |
| What was the first request? | `ctx_search(queries: ["prompt"], source: "user-prompt", sort: "timeline")` |
| What did we decide? | `ctx_search(queries: ["decision"], source: "decision", sort: "timeline")` |
| What NOT to repeat? | `ctx_search(queries: ["rejected"], source: "rejected-approach")` |
| What constraints exist? | `ctx_search(queries: ["constraint"], source: "constraint")` |

DO NOT ask "what were we working on?" — SEARCH FIRST.
If search returns 0 results, proceed as a fresh session.

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call `ctx_stats` MCP tool, display full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call `ctx_doctor` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call `ctx_upgrade` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx purge` | Call `ctx_purge` MCP tool with confirm: true. Warns before wiping knowledge base. |

After /clear or /compact: knowledge base and session stats preserved. Use `ctx purge` to start fresh.
